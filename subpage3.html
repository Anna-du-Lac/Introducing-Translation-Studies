	<p>The analysis of translation shifts, including stylistic shifts, seeks to describe the phenomenon of translation, classifying the changes that can be observed from comparing ST–TT pairs. It is a means of describing what constitutes the translation product, but there are limits to what it can (or even attempts to) tell us about the actual cognitive process of translation. Other models choose a different approach, based on the observation, analysis and/or explanation of the cognitive processes of the translators themselves. As Roger Bell puts it: ‘focus on the description of the process and/or the translator … form the twin issues which translation theory must address: how the process takes place and what knowledge and skills the translator must possess in order to carry it out’. Thus, for example, the <b>"interpretive model"</b> of translation, championed in Paris from the 1960s onwards by Danica Seleskovitch and Marianne Lederer and initially applied to the study of conference interpreting, explains translation as an (overlapping) three-stage process involving the following:</p>

	<p>Some theorists have sought to gather detailed observational data towards the explanation of the translator’s decision-making processes. One method, particularly popular in the 1990s, is <b>think-aloud protocols (TAPs)</b>. In this type of study, the translator is asked to verbalize his/her thought processes while translating or immediately afterwards (the latter being known as <b>retrospective protocol</b>), often with no prompting on content. This is usually recorded by the researcher and later transcribed and analysed.</p>
	
	<p>More recent methods have ‘triangulated’ think-aloud protocols with <b>technological innovations</b>. That is, they support or supplement think-aloud with other experimental methods. These include:<br>
1. Video recording and observation of the subjects;<br>
2. Use of pre- or post-test interviews and/or questionnaires;<br>
3. Use of Translog software at the Copenhagen Business School, which records the keystrokes made by the translator on the computer keyboard;<br>
4. Use of eye-trackers, which record the focus of the eye on the text. The length of such fixation points, and the dilation of the pupil, may indicate the mental effort being made by the translator;<br>
5. Use of EEG, fMARI, PET, etc., to learn the temporal or spacial changes that is induced by the translational activities.
