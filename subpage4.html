	<p>The emergence and proliferation of multimodal texts and digital technology have opened the field of translation to new genres, new distribution platforms and new reception contexts. Together with the development of new translation tools, this has transformed translation practice and forced theory to revisit old concepts and embrace new ones. This chapter briefly looks at the new directions opened up in two fields: <b>audiovisual translation</b> and <b>localization</b> (that's what we are doing!), <b>globalization</b> and <b>transcreation</b></p>
	
	<p>Inevitably, the newly emerging technologies expand the possible modalities of translation and interpreting, as Taylor specifies for transcription:</p>

	<p>And there is what we are doing now--<b>localization</b>: the combination of a sociocultural region and a language in industrial setting’. Localization may involve the substitution of inappropriate cultural symbols and the translation of text, including the need to fit specific space constraints on the screen/page etc. Dunne makes the important point that localization is a “focal point in the corporate matrix”, an intersection of development and authoring, sales, marketing (promotional materials may need to be redesigned), legal advice (to comply with local legislation) and management (concerned to restrict costs).</p>
		
	<p>The difference between localization and translation is blurred, but generally localization is seen by industry as a superordinate term that encompasses translation. Thus, in the words of LISA, the Localization Industry Standards Association, operational from 1990 to 2011, <b>“localization”</b> involves taking a product and making it linguistically and culturally appropriate to the target locale (country/region and language) where it will be used and sold. More recently, GALA, the Globalization and Localization Association, defines localization as ‘the process of adapting a product or service to a specific locale. <b>Translation is only one of several elements in the localization process</b>, which most of us are experiencing.</p>
