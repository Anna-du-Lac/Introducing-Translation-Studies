	<h1>The names and sometimes nature of Translation Studies

	<p>The main aim of this page is to introduce the reader to some major concepts and models of translation studies. The readers are also referred to Chapter 1 of Introducing Translation Studies edited by Jeremy Munday for more details. Because the research being undertaken in this field is now so extensive, the material selected is necessarily only representative and illustrative of the major trends. For reasons of space and consistency of approach, the focus is on written translation rather than oral translation (the latter is commonly known as <b>interpreting</b> or <b>interpretation</b>), although the overlaps make a clear distinction impossible. As often happens, the advance of theory has brought nuance to the definition. The simplistic division between written and oral has been replaced by a more sophisticated description that analyses the contribution of various contextual features. Thus, more subtly, interpreting is defined by Otto Kade as ‘a form of Translation (in the wider sense) in which (a) the source language text is presented only once and thus cannot be reviewed or replayed, and (b) the target language text is produced under time pressure, with little chance for correction and revision’ With this focus established, we shall use this first chapter to relate the main framework and scope of the field of Translation Studies.</p>
	
	<p>Throughout history, written and spoken translations have played a crucial role in interhuman communication, not least in providing access to important texts for scholarship and religious purposes. As world trade has grown, so has the importance of translation. By 2019, the global market for outsourced translation, interpreting and related technologies was estimated to exceed US$46.52 billion (up from US$38 billion in 2015), while international organizations such as the European Union translate between 24 languages and spend some €1.1 billion per year on translation and interpreting services.5 Yet the study of translation as an academic subject only really began in the second half of the twentieth century. In the English-speaking world, this discipline is now generally known as “<b>translation studies</b>”, thanks to the Dutch-based US scholar James S. Holmes, one of the fathers of the famous “map” below in his renowned work, <em><b>the Name and Nature of Translation Studies</b></em> (the title starts to ring a bell now, isn't it?).</p>

	<p>But, generally translation studies is an academic research area that has expanded massively over the years. Translation was formerly studied as a language-learning methodology or as part of comparative literature, translation “workshops” and contrastive linguistics courses. The discipline as we now know it owes much to the work of James S. Holmes, who proposed both a name and a structure for the field, but the context has now advanced. The interrelated branches of theoretical, descriptive and applied translation studies initially structured research. Over time, the interdisciplinarity and specialization of the subject have become more evident and theories and models have continued to be imported from other disciplines, but also forged from within translation studies itself.</p>
