	Equivalence, the divine halo or the sword of Damocles?
</h1>
	<hr>
	<div id="mainbody">
	<p>When talking about translation, the first word that pumps up is, for presumably quite a lot of people, should be "<b>equivalence</b> or something just like that. It almost looks like that without equivalence, there can be no translation (surely what translation is in itself is debatable enough). But is that so? Can equivalence truely be the divine halo above "translation", or it is to that the sword of Damocles upon whose fall the fragile discipline will be returned to dust? In this pag, we are to check Prof. Halverson's view, together with some teeny tiny bit of the author(that is, I)'s on the notion of equivalence (the latter comes mostly from the term paper of the course <em>Comtemporary Translation Studies</em> given by Prof. Wu Qing whom I thank deeply for her inspiration as a role model, academically and beyond.</p>
	
	<p>Halverson believes that within translation studies, there remains a certain amount of unnecessary discord concerning the use of the equivalence concept and its relevance for translation theory. In the interest of better understanding the various points of view, it seems helpful to consider different perspectives on this concept in light of the varying <b>philosophical assumptions</b> on which they are based. Analogies between the equivalence concept and a concept of scientific knowledge as it is and has been studied within the philosophy of science are highly informative in pointing out the philosophical issues involved in equivalence, translation, and knowledge. Rather than dismissing the concept as ill-defined or imprecise, it is in the interest of the field of translation studies to consider the origins and manifestations of this "imprecision" in order that we may be better informed and less inclined towards theoretical antagonism.</p>
		
	<p>In the end of this essay <em>the Concept of Equivalence: Much Ado About Something</em>, he concluded thus that we have, in fact, arrived at, or perhaps returned to, the crux of the whole translation/knowledge problem, the essence of the translatability/commensurability impasse. And this is why translation so often figures as a metaphor for that process which may, in terms of another metaphor, be described as a bridge between mutually unintelligible messages, a bridge which is absolutely necessary for either comparison or communication itself. As philosophers debate the nature of meaning, or the nature of knowledge, so do translation scholars ponder the nature of their specific bridge, and it is that problematic complex that all the ado is about.</p>
		
	<p>On my side, I do somewhat agree that some "equivalence" must be there to define "translation". But what is it? From the "dynamic equivalence" that is so popular among BTI and MTI students, to more systematic aspects (such as Koller's concept of equivalence) of this notion, or even to the then mysterious and now seemingly clearer "sense equivalence", translation is bound by some EQUIVALENCE qualities between the source something and the target something. Yet the relation between the source and the target seems to be something even more unexplicable than this year's Nobel Prize of Physics. People would say that equivalence is gone, outdated, or at least unpublishable. But that would be we running away from a problem of which we are simply tired of seeking ths answer. Sure, there are other aspects of translation (no less worthy of exploring) just as there are infinite ways to study the metal "gold". While we are discussing its market prices, maybe there should also be someone asking about the relative atomic mass of gold.</p>
		
	<p>As a human being, the search for meanning, I think, is an instinct. We cannot let it go way. We should not let it go away. We must get there.</p>
